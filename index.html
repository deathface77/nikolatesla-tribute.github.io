            <h1>Meet Nikola Tesla</h1>
            <p>Born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, Croatia, <b>Nikola Tesla</b> was a visionary inventor and electrical engineer whose work revolutionized the field of electricity. From a young age, Tesla showed a natural talent for physics and mathematics, and after studying engineering, he moved to the United States in 1884. In the U.S., he worked briefly with Thomas A Edison before striking out on his own to pursue his groundbreaking ideas. Tesla is best known for his work on alternating current (AC) electrical systems, which became the foundation for modern electrical grids.</p>

            <p>Through out his life, <b>Nikola Tesla</b> pioneered advancements in radio transmission, wireless communication, and even early concepts of robotics. One of his most famous demonstrations was the Tesla coil, which is still used in radio technology today. Despite his brilliance, Tesla struggled with financial difficulties throughout his life. Many of his ideas, like wireless power transmission, were too advanced for his time and were never fully realized during his lifetime.</p>
